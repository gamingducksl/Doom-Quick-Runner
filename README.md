Doom Quick Runner:

This is a program made for launching Doom (duh). I mainly created this to launch Demo files easier.
The program was tested using Linux Mint, so it probably won't work on Windows.

Tested source-ports: Crispy Doom and Chocolate Doom

Usage:

Run the "start.sh" file (make sure to run it in terminal).

Input your source port of choice (example: crispy-doom). This will use whichever terminal command you use to launch the source port.

Input your iwad, pwad, and demo file paths (these are all optional, though, if no iwad is specified then it will use the default iwad.).

Run!
